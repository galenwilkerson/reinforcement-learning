    "# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to Reinforcement Learning (RL), a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve some goal. The agent learns from the outcomes of its actions, rather than from being told explicitly what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Description of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The key concept is learning through trial and error, primarily based on feedback from actions taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL:\n",
    "- An **agent** takes actions in an environment.\n",
    "- The environment then responds to these actions and presents new situations to the agent.\n",
    "- The agent receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on its actions.\n",
    "- Over time, the agent learns to take actions that maximize rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is for the agent to develop a strategy, or **policy**, for deciding actions based on the state of the environment that leads to the most reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive Example of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine training a dog to perform a trick, like fetching a ball. Here, the dog is the **agent** and the room where it learns is the **environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Action**: The dog tries different approaches to fetch the ball.\n",
    "2. **Reward**: If the dog successfully fetches the ball, it receives a treat.\n",
    "3. **Policy Development**: Over multiple attempts, the dog starts understanding which actions (like running towards the ball and grabbing it with its mouth) lead to treats.\n",
    "4. **Optimized Behavior**: Eventually, the dog learns the most effective way to fetch the ball to maximize its treats.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the dog is using reinforcement learning. It tries different actions, learns from the results, and refines its approach to improve the outcome. In computer algorithms, a similar process occurs where an AI agent learns from the consequences of its actions in a simulated environment."

    "## Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.\n",
    "2. **Environment**: What the agent interacts with, comprising everything the agent interacts with.\n",
    "3. **Action**: All possible moves the agent can make.\n",
    "4. **Reward**: Feedback from the environment based on the action taken by the agent.\n",
    "5. **State**: A representation of the current situation returned by the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective in RL is to develop a strategy, known as a policy, that the agent can use to decide its actions based on the current state to maximize cumulative future rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the implementation and examples to understand these concepts better."
