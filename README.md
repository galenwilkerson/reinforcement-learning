# Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook adapted from a tutorial found at [amunategui.github.io/reinforcement-learning](http://amunategui.github.io/reinforcement-learning/), offering an introductory exploration into Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal. This learning process is based on the agent's actions and the feedback received as consequences of these actions.

## Installation

To interact with the notebook in this repository, Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment are required.

### Steps:
1. Ensure Python is installed. We recommend using Python version 3.6 or above.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Reinforcement-Learning.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory.
4. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Usage

After installing the required dependencies, you can launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the `.ipynb` file.

```
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook in the Jupyter interface and run the cells to understand the principles of Reinforcement Learning.

## Acknowledgments

This notebook is adapted from a tutorial by [amunategui.github.io](http://amunategui.github.io/reinforcement-learning/).

This version of the `README.md` is focused on the Reinforcement Learning notebook and omits any mention of Random Boolean Networks, ensuring it aligns with the content of your repository.
