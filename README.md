# Reinforcement Learning in Random Boolean Networks

Adapted from tutorial:  http://amunategui.github.io/reinforcement-learning/


This repository contains resources and code for exploring Reinforcement Learning (RL) within the context of Random Boolean Networks (RBNs). RBNs, known for their applicability in modeling complex systems, are used here as a framework to study and implement reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Introduction

Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) are a simplified model of genetic regulatory networks. In this repository, we delve into the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within RBNs. The goal is to explore how RL can be leveraged to understand and predict the behavior of these networks.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need Python and some specific libraries. The primary dependencies are Jupyter Notebooks for interactive coding and visualization, along with libraries like NumPy for numerical operations.

### Steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed. We recommend using Python 3.6 or above.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/Random-Boolean-Networks.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory.
4. It's recommended to create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```


## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can start Jupyter Notebook and explore the `.ipynb` files.

```
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the desired notebook in the Jupyter Notebook interface and run the cells to see the results.

## Files in the Repository
